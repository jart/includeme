includeme.el â€“ Auto C/C++ '#include' and 'using' in Emacs
=========================================================

**Demo Video: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhs5r-iGpNU>**

includeme is an extension for GNU Emacs that will automatically insert
    #include
C/C++ and it's 100% guaranteed to actually work. For instance if you started
writing a new C++ program and typed `cout` and then pressed the magic key,
includeme would then insert `#include <iostream>` and `using std::cout` at
the top of your file.

So what's the catch? It only works for popular and standardized
APIs. No attempt is made whatsoever to analyse your code. includeme
comes with a database of all the symbol and header definitions for
libraries deemed important by Justine Tunney. Things like POSIX,
the Standard C Library, C++ STL, etc.

Installation
------------

Run `make` and put this stuff in your init file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/PATH/TO/INCLUDEME")
    (require 'includeme)
    (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "C-c i") 'includeme)

Function Documentation
----------------------

### `(includeme)`

Insert headers and using statements necessary to for name
under cursor to compile.

For example if you type "std::cout" and run this command in a
C++ buffer, includeme will insert `#include <iostream>` at the
top of your buffer. If you had only typed "cout" then includeme
would have also inserted a `using std::cout` statement.
