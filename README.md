includeme is an extension for GNU Emacs that will automatically insert
`#include` and `using` statements into your source code while you write
C/C++ and it's 100% guaranteed to actually work. For instance if you started
writing a new C++ program and typed `cout` and then pressed the magic key,
includeme would then insert `#include <iostream>` and `using std::cout` at
the top of your file.

So what's the catch? It only works for popular and standardized
APIs. No attempt is made whatsoever to analyse your code. includeme
comes with a database of all the symbol and header definitions for
libraries deemed important by Justine Tunney. Things like POSIX,
the Standard C Library, C++ STL, etc.

### Installation


Put this stuff in your init file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/PATH/TO/INCLUDEME")
    (require 'includeme)
    (define-key c-mode-base-map (kbd "C-c i") 'includeme)



### Customization Documentation

#### `includeme-indexes`

An alist of files for each mode containing symbol/headers tables.

You can use this variable to add your own symbol tables. Here's
an example of how to do it: Create "my-proj-headers.el"
somewhere on your emacs load path with the code below. Once
that's done you must customize the variable (M-x
customize-variable) `includeme-indexes` to add the name of your
file to the list for your mode (in this case, c++-mode). Then run
`includeme-reload`.

    ;; my-proj-headers.el
    (setq includeme! '(
      ("my_proj_func1" my_proj/funcs.h)  ;; Function with one header.
      ("my_proj_func2" my_proj/funcs.h)
      ("lol::MyClass" lol/MyClass.h lol/class_defs.h)  ;; Two headers.
      ("MyClass" . "lol::MyClass")  ;; Use that dot for canonical names.
      ;; etc...
    ))


### Function and Macro Documentation

#### `(includeme)`

Insert headers and using statements necessary to for name
under cursor to compile.
For example if you type "std::cout" and run this command in a
C++ buffer, includeme will insert `#include <iostream>` at the
top of your buffer. If you had only typed "cout" then includeme
would have also inserted a `using std::cout` statement.
